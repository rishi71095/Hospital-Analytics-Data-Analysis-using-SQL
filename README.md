# Project Description:

This is a data analysis project using SQL, created by Maven Analytics, called Hospital Analytics. The goal of this project is to analyze hospital patient encounters, costs, and behavior trends to gain insights into hospital operations and patient care patterns.

The project is divided into three main objectives, each focusing on a different aspect of hospital data:

## ðŸ”¹ Objective 1 â€“ Encounters Overview
We will analyze the encounters table to understand how patients interact with the hospital.

* Total encounters per year
* Percentage of encounters by class (ambulatory, outpatient, wellness, urgent care, emergency, inpatient)
* Percentage of encounters lasting more than or less than 24 hours

## ðŸ”¹ Objective 2 â€“ Cost & Coverage Insights
We will analyze the encounters table to understand how patients interact with the hospital.

* Encounters with zero payer coverage and their percentage
* Top 10 most frequent procedures and their average base cost
* Top 10 procedures with the highest average cost and their frequency
* Average total claim cost per encounter by payer

## ðŸ”¹ Objective 3 â€“ Patient Behavior Analysis
We will study patient behavior and readmissions to track hospital usage patterns.

* Unique patient admissions by quarter
* Patients readmitted within 30 days of a previous encounter
* Patients with the highest number of readmissions


This project is perfect for practicing SQL skills, as it requires writing queries to aggregate, filter, and analyze data across tables. It simulates real-world healthcare analytics tasks, making it a great addition to a data analytics portfolio.

_ðŸ“Œ The dataset and project are provided by Maven Analytics to their subscribers for learning and portfolio-building purposes._
